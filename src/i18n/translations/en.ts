				content: 'The "Collegium vincere ALS" is an association dedicated to the fight against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a chronic degenerative disease of the motor nervous system. We see ALS as a "disease of a thousand farewells" and want to support those affected and their families during this difficult time. Our goals include comprehensive care for those affected, intensive public relations work to raise awareness of ALS, networking relevant stakeholders, and promoting ALS research. With actions such as themed tables and our mobile ALS case, we aim to inform and collect donations to initiate research projects and thereby improve the quality of life of those affected. If you have questions, are seeking help, or would like to support our work - contact us, because your quality of life is important to us!'
