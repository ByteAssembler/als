					“Collegium vincere ALS eo” is an association dedicated to
					the fight against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a
					chronic degenerative disease of the motor nervous system. We
					see ALS as a “disease of a thousand farewells” and would
					like to stand by those affected and their relatives during
					this difficult time. Our goals include comprehensive support
					for those affected, intensive public relations work to raise
					awareness of ALS, networking relevant stakeholders and
					promoting ALS research. With campaigns such as theme tables
					and our mobile ALS suitcase, we want to provide information
					and collect donations to initiate research projects and thus
					improve the quality of life of those affected. If you have
					any questions, are looking for help or would like to support
					our work - get in touch with us, because your quality of
					life is important to us!
